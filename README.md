```

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with specific instructions for running that particular project.

## How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-complete-course.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Specific Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd java-basics
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Project**:
   For Java projects, you can use Maven or Gradle to build, or simply compile with `javac` if you're running it from the terminal.

   Example using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn exec:java
   ```
